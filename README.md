# steamsaleforecaster_reboot
A complete revision of the steamforecaster project

## What is it?
The original Steam Sale Forecaster (SSF) was a website that predicted whether a game on the computer game store Steam would go on sale in the next two weeks. The project was conceived, designed, and implemented within a three week time span during my tenure as an [Insight Data Science Fellow](http://insightdatascience.com/).  
  
  This project is a complete revision, from scratch, of the original SSF. Instead of simple creating a new branch and make small, iterative tweaks, I wanted to recreate SSF using many of the new tools and design principles that I've learned since the original implementation. 
  
## Current Status?
The SSF reboot is currently under construction.
